System update

* Add an experimental (optional, not enabled by default) feature to prevent STDIN closure, thereby preventing builds from mysteriously throwing errors. Please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us) for more information if you are experiencing STDIN closure issues with your build.

If you have any concerns about these changes, please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).
