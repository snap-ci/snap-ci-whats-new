Default ChromeDriver versions upgraded to 2.24

* We updated the default version of ChromeDriver from 2.19 to 2.24.
* We are still planning on dropping support for versions before ChromeDriver v2.18, which was released on 2015-08-19.
* We recommend that you use the most recent version when possible, but if you need an old version of ChromeDriver, you can specify it by adding the environment variable `CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION = 2.19` (or whatever version you need) to your build.

Packages upgraded:

* No packages changed on the Aurora stack.
* Some packages have been upgraded on the Cybele stack. Users builds should not be impacted as these are minor changes. You can [see Cybele differences](https://s3.amazonaws.com/whats-new-prod/assets/packages/ubuntu/diff-1039-to-1040.html).
* See the complete list of packages in our [documentation](https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/complete-package-list/).
