Package updates

* Chrome Driver versions before 2.18 are removed.  
This will only affect you if you are explicitly setting a version of chromedriver that is before 2.18.

* Removed the Postgres plugin pgrouting_92, because it is incompatible with updated versions of Postgres 9.3. To add the plugin back to your build, add these two commands:`sudo yum remove CGAL-4.7-1.rhel6` ` sudo yum install pgrouting_92 `
