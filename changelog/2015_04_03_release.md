Better control over pull requests

* Snap will only start building new pull requests after you choose to
* You can also select the which stages to run on your pull requests builds

Secure files

* We now allow uploading of secure binary files, in addition to text content. This will be useful for uploading files containing java keystores, gpg keys etc.

Run builds on schedule (aka, cron)

* It is now possible to run your builds on a schedule. You can run this to perform nightly builds, or maintainance tasks like taking nightly backups etc.

All of this was built thanks to your [feedback](http://snap-ci.com/contact-us). Thanks for helping us out!
