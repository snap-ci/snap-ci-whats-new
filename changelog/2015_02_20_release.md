Changes to Heroku deployments

* We are happy to announce that we have switched our heroku deployment strategy to use [HTTP git](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/12/5/http_git_now_generally_available).
* Please [write to us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us) if you need more information about these changes.

Small improvements, bug fixes

* Fixed a bug that would cause builds to hangup when an integration pipeline stage would go into a waiting state.
* Added `--instance-ids` argument to AWS OpsWorks deployments. Checkout our [docs](https://docs.snap-ci.com/deployments/aws-deployments/aws-opsworks-deployments/#command-line-usage-of-snap-deploy-for-opsworks-deployments) for more details. Thanks a lot [Diego Milan](https://github.com/dmilanp) for the contribution.
