Changes to Heroku deployments

* A few months ago, Heroku made [HTTP git](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/12/5/http_git_now_generally_available) general availability.
* This allows users to deploy to heroku without the use of [SSH keys](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys) using the Heroku tokens.
* Today, we are happy to announce that we have switched our heroku deployment strategy to use HTTP git.
* This implies that soon we will be able to remove any SSH keys Snap has added to your heroku apps and we recommend any users using custom heroku deployment stages to switch to HTTP git.
* Please [write to us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us) if you need more information about these changes.


Small improvements, bug fixes

* Fixed a bug that would cause builds to hangup when an integration pipeline stage would go into a waiting state.
* Added `--instance-ids` argument to AWS OpsWorks deployments. Checkout our [docs](https://docs.snap-ci.com/deployments/aws-deployments/aws-opsworks-deployments/#command-line-usage-of-snap-deploy-for-opsworks-deployments) for more details. Thanks a lot [Diego Milan](https://github.com/dmilanp) for the contribution.
