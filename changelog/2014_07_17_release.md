sudo make me a sandwich, aka moar sudo.

Snap already provided sudo access to install your packages using `yum`, `gem` and `npm`.

* Since we rolled out PHP last week, we now offer sudo access for `pear`, `peardev` and `pecl`.
* Few people asked to install services, so Snap now offers sudo access to `/etc/init.d/YOURSERVICE [start|stop|restart]` and `service YOURSERVICE [start|stop|restart]`

Some users have had issues with editing of their build configuration, we have fixed all of these issues.

We want to hear from you! If you have any feedback or features you would love to see in Snap, [click here](http://snap-ci.com/contact-us) and let us know.
