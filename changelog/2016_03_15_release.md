Upgrade default Ruby to 2.2.4:

* In case you don't specify a ruby version in your build configuration Snap will run your build with a default ruby in the PATH. We have just updated this default version from 2.1.5 to 2.2.4.

Packages upgraded:

* Some packages have been upgraded. Users builds shouldn't be impacted as there are only minor changes. You can check the differences [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/whats-new-prod/assets/packages/centos/diff-341-to-350.txt) and also the complete list of packages in our [documentation](https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/complete-package-list/).
