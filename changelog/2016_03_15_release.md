Upgrade default Ruby to 2.2.4:

* In the case where you do not specify a Ruby version in your build configuration Snap will run your build with a default Ruby in the PATH. We have just updated this default version from ruby 2.1.5 to ruby 2.2.4.

Packages upgraded:

* Some packages have been upgraded. Users builds should not be impacted as these are minor changes. You can [check the differences](https://s3.amazonaws.com/whats-new-prod/assets/packages/centos/diff-341-to-350.html) and also the complete list of packages in our [documentation](https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/complete-package-list/).
