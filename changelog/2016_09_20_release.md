Chrome Upgraded to version 53 and new ChromeDriver versions added

* To keep current with Chrome, we are upgrading to version 53.
* We added newer versions of ChromeDriver (2.20 - 2.24) to support the current version of Chrome.  See more about how to user ChromeDriver at [testing with browsers](https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/testing-with-browsers/)
* On September 30th, 2016, we will update the default version of ChromeDriver from 2.19 to 2.24.  We will also drop support for versions before ChromeDriver v2.18, which was released on 2015-08-19.
* You can try out the current version of ChromeDriver now by adding the environment variable `CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION = 2.24` to your build.
