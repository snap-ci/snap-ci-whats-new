Bug fixes

* Fixed issues with cache corruption of builds.
* Fix a backend issue that caused the last stage of an integration pipeline to be stuck in the waiting state forever.
* Secure files can now be added to Custom Heroku stages.
* Whenever you transfer a repository to an owner with inadequate GitHub permissions, we now ask the user to fix the permissions before they accept the transfer. This should prevent problems when fixing GitHub connectivity for transferred repositories.
* Fixed problems with some stages being stuck in the Cloning state forever.
* Custom heroku stages now perform a heroku update before they run any other heroku command to make sure the toolbelt is updated.
