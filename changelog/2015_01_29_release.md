Choose bigger size workers -

* For faster feedback, in addition to increasing the number of workers, Snap now lets you increase the size of each worker. By default, workers on Snap are 2GB and 2 cores each. We now provide the ability to choose bigger size boxes. This setting is available to you when you configure the stages in your pipeline. Read more about it on our [docs site](https://docs.snap-ci.com/workers/configuring-workers/).

Spanky new APIs -

* We would like to announce a set of new APIs to fetch pipeline history and artifacts, and to trigger new builds. Read more about it on our [docs site](https://docs.snap-ci.com/api/).

Ghost vulnerability -

* Yesterday a vulnerability in the glibc library - `CVE-2015-0235` "Ghost" was disclosed. We've already updated all our build environments to resolve this issue. You can find more about this vulnerability in this excellent [post from Qualys](https://community.qualys.com/blogs/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2015/01/27/the-ghost-vulnerability).

Little things -

* We have updated the version of our Oracle JDKs to `1.8.0_31` and `1.7.0_75`. JDK 6 continues to be the same - `1.6.0_45`.
* We have also updated gradle to `2.2.1`.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes in the frontend and backend to improve build stability for some of our users who had been facing persistent "Try running your build again" type of errors.
