Choose a bigger size workers -

* By default, workers on Snap are 2GB and 2 cores each. We now provide the ability to choose bigger size boxes. This setting is available to you when you configure the stages in your pipeline. Read more about it on our [docs site](https://docs.snap-ci.com/workers/configuring-workers/).

Spanky new APIs -

* We would like to announce a set of new APIs to fetch pipeline history and artifacts, and to trigger new builds. Read more about it on our [docs site](https://docs.snap-ci.com/api/).

Little things -

* We have updated the version of JDKs available to the latest versions from Oracle.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes in the frontend and backend to improve build stability for some of our users who had been facing persistent "Try running your build again" type of errors.
