Chrome Driver versions before 2.18 are removed

* This will only affect you if you are explicitly setting a version of chromedriver that is before 2.18.

Removed the Postgres plugin pgrouting\_92

* Postgres plugin pgrouting\_92 is incompatible with updated versions of Postgres 9.3 so it was removed.
* To add the plugin back to your build, add these two commands: `sudo yum remove CGAL-4.7-1.rhel6 && sudo yum install pgrouting\_92`
* [See Aurora package changes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/whats-new-prod/assets/packages/centos/diff-1022-to-1023.html).
* [See Cybele package changes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/whats-new-prod/assets/packages/ubuntu/diff-1040-to-1041.html).
