Packages upgraded:

* In order to resolve some campatibility issue with capybara webkit, we've release a new version of qt5-qtwebkit 5.5.1 that we've packaged ourselves. This should not impact any builds, but if you notice any stability issues with your capybara webkit builds please let us know. You can [check the differences](https://s3.amazonaws.com/whats-new-prod/assets/packages/centos/diff-366-to-371.html) and also the complete list of packages in our [documentation](https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/complete-package-list/).

If you have any concerns about these changes, please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).
