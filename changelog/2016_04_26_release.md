Packages upgraded:

* QT upgraded Qt5-qtwebkit from 5.5.1 to 5.6, and removed 5.5.1 from CentOS. Capybara-webkit isn't compatible with qt5-qtwebkit 5.6, and is explicitly not going to support it in the future. We've packaged qt5-qtwebkit 5.5.1 ourselves, and installed it until capybara-webkit has a permanent solution. Users builds should hopefully not be impacted. You can [check the differences](https://s3.amazonaws.com/whats-new-prod/assets/packages/centos/diff-366-to-371.html) and also the complete list of packages in our [documentation](https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/complete-package-list/).
