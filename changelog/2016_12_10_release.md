Performance improvements

In a series of ongoing performance fixes, we have change the manner in which we route traffic through the various sites in Snap. The most visible changes are:

 * The build dashboard is now hosted at app.snap-ci.com/dashboard. However, all old routes continue to work and we expect all users to continue to access Snap as usual over https://snap-ci.com
 * We have updated all webhooks for unhalted repositories to send their payloads to the app.snap-ci.com subdomain. Once again, this will not have any impact for users and all builds should continue to run as before.
 * Larger portions of the application are now served directly from our CDN and so should appear faster.

If you are impacted by any of these issues or have any concerns please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).

We hope you find a noticeable improvement in the "snappiness" of the app! :)
