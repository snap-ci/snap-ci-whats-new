Tips on Build configuration edits

* We now provide tips for various popular commands which may help in speeding up your builds, gotchas you might have when using them, etc.

Little things, nice things and bug fixes

* Fixed an issue on the build history page where it would not update how long ago the stage ran.
* Fixed the auto-tailing of console logs on Firefox.
* The name of the person who triggers a manual stage is available as an environment variable to your build: SNAP\_STAGE\_TRIGGERED\_BY
* You can remove an environment variable and and add another with the same name in without triggering an error. Oops!
* The value of a newly created environment variable is preserved across stages when editing a plan.
