Chromedriver changes

* We have added support for chromedriver `2.19`
* We have also updated our default chromedriver from `2.10` to `2.19` due to auto-updating of Chrome to version [incompatible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32792739/selenium-unexpectedly-having-issues) with the chromedriver version which caused failures on some of users' builds when running browser specs.
* If you wish to continue using `2.10`, just set the `CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION` environment variable and have a look at our [docs for more info](https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/testing-with-browsers/#using-chromedriver).

Put bundled gems on PATH

* `bundle install` will now automatically generate binstubs and put them on PATH so that you can use them in your builds without having to type `bundle exec` before running your binary.
