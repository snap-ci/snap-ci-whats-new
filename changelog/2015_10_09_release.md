Chromedriver changes
* We have added support for chromedriver `2.19`

* We have also made `2.19` our default version of chromedriver due to incompatibilities and recent failures when running browser specs.

Put bundled gems on PATH

* `bundle install` will now automatically generate binstubs and put them on PATH so that you can use them in your builds without having to type `bundle exec` before running your binary.
