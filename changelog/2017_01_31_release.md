Planned changes

We will make the following system updates on February 1st after 10 am PST.

* Update rbenv installation in Aurora and Cybele containers.
* Update ruby installations. Snap will have support for the latest MRI (up through 2.4.0) and JRuby (up through 9.1.7.0).
    * For legacy versions of MRI, we will only support the latest patch level (1.8.7-p375, 1.9.2-p330, 1.9.3-p551, 2.0.0-p648).
    * JRuby 9.0.3.0 was removed due to issues in Cybele containers. JRuby 9.0.4.0 has resolved these issues, so please update to a later version if you were using 9.0.3.0.
* Minor updates to Cybele packages.
    * [See Cybele package changes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/whats-new-prod/assets/packages/ubuntu/diff-1051-to-1054.html).
