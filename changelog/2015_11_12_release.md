NPM caching changes

* Earlier we were caching the `node_modules` directory and making it available in the build directory by symlinking it.
* A few users when running with the latest `npm 3.x` and updating dependencies started seeing problems because of this symlinked node_modules directory and figured out that this was [issue with npm](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10013).
* In order to get rid of these issues, we replaced the symlink by a move operation and now the entire `node_modules` directory is moved into the build directory before running any commands.
* Let us know if you are still facing problems with npm.
