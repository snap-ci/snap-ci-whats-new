Run commands in your builds just as you would on your terminal

* All commands for a stage now run in the same terminal which allows you to run commands like `cd`, `export`, etc.
* Take a look at [our blog](http://bit.ly/shell-changes) for more details.

A bunch of new packages now in available for your builds

* We've upgraded MySQL from `5.1` to `5.6`
* We've upgraded our redis from `2.4.10` to `2.8.17`
* We've introduced ruby `2.1.4` and ruby `2.1.5` is coming soon.

Easier and faster to use yum

* Running `yum install` now doesn't require you to specify the `--assumeyes` or the `-y` argument.
* Yum now takes advantage of the [caching in snap](http://docs.snap-ci.com/speeding-up-builds/caching/) and caches the packages which should make your subsequent builds run faster.

Some bug fixes

* A major bug with manual trigger cancellations not being reflected on the UI and appearing to run forever.
* A bug that used to cause some java builds to consume excessive memory and die.
