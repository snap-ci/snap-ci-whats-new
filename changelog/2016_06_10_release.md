Small fixes and system updates

* We have added a change to prevent you from clicking the save configuration button twice. This makes for a nicer experience when saving your configuration. 
* We have also made some non-user facing system updates on the Aurora stack.

If you have any concerns about these changes, please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).
