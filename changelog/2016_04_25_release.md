New stacks, new docs

* We are introducing the concept of stacks on Snap CI. A stack is a CI environment on which you can run your builds. Our stacks support different operating systems and packages that support different CI environment needs. Currently we have two stacks: the main production stack, now called 'Aurora', and a new stack called 'Cybele'. 'Aurora' (from the Roman goddess of Dawn) was our first stack and is the stack that the majority of Snap CI users are building on. This will remain our primary stack in the short term. We are also introducing a new stack called â€˜Cybele. Cybele (also known as Magna Mater or "Great Mother" in Roman mythology) is in beta support and is currently only available on request.

* The primary differences between these stacks are that Aurora runs on CentOS 6.7 and Cybele runs on Ubuntu. Cybele has support for running Docker containers. You can read more about the differences between these stacks in our documentation.

* To support these changes we have also made multiple updates to our documentation and our website. 

If you'd like access to Cybele to use our Docker support or to understand any other changes we have made [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).
