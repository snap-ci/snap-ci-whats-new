Introducing Snap CI's stacks

* We are introducing the concept of stacks on Snap CI. A stack is a CI environment on which you can run your builds. Our stacks support different operating systems and packages that support different CI environment needs. Currently we have two stacks: the main production stack, now called 'Aurora', and a new stack called 'Cybele'. 
* 'Aurora' (from the Roman goddess of dawn) was our first stack and is the stack that the majority of Snap CI users are building on. This will remain our primary stack in the short term. We are also introducing a new stack called â€˜Cybele'.
* Cybele (named after the Earth Mother goddess also known as Magna Mater or "Great Mother" in Roman mythology) is in beta support and is currently only available upon request. 
* Currently the primary differences between these two stacks are that Aurora runs on CentOS and Cybele runs on Ubuntu. Cybele also has support for running [Docker] (https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/docker/) containers as part of your deployment pipeline. You can read more about the differences between these stacks in our [documentation] (https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/stacks/).

If you'd like access to Cybele to use our Ubuntu or Docker support please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).
