Fixed: `node_modules` caching changes

* Earlier we used to symlink the `node_modules` in the currently working directory from the cache directory. This caused [some issues when performing npm install](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10013).
* In order to fix this problem, we have now move the `node_modules` directory into the working directory in the beginning of each stage. The `node_modules` directory is moved back into the cache directory at the end of each stage.
* Even though we are caching `node_modules` we still suggest pinning the `npm install` command as we don't guarantee that the directory will be available to subsequent stages due to [diagonal parallelism](https://docs.snap-ci.com/speeding-up-builds/pipeline-parallelism/#diagonal-parallelism) of pipeline instances.

Fixed version of npm

* Some of you may have noticed unexpected errors when running `npm install` today. This was because of a [bug in the latest npm](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10492). In order to avoid such unexpected errors in the future, we have pinned our npm to version `3.3.12`.
* We will be regularly updating npm in a more controlled manner so as to avoid such failures.

If you have any feedback about the recent changes to npm and caching of node_modules we would like to know. Feel free to [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).
