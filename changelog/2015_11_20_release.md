Fixed: `node_modules` caching changes

* We have now fixed the npm caching and now move the `node_modules` directory into the working directory in the beggining of each stage.
* The `node_modules` directory is moved back into the cache directory at the end of each stage.

Fixed version of npm

* Some of you may have noticed unexpected errors when running `npm install` today. This was because of a [bug in the latest npm](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10492). In order to avoid such unexpected errors in the future, we have pinned our npm to version `3.3.12`.
* We will be regularly updating npm in a more controlled manner so as to avoid such failures.

If you have any feedback about the recent changes to npm and caching of node_modules we would like to know. Feel free to [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).
