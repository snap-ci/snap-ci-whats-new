New persistent caching rolled out

* After testing with a small set of builds we have rolled out our new persistent caching to all builds on Aurora and Cybele. You should expect improved build time consistency with this update. As a reminder Docker images [are not cached] (https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/docker/known-limitations/) between pipelines.

Please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us) if you see anything that concerns you.
