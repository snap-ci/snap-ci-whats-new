New persistent caching rolled out
* After dark launching to a small set of builds we have rolled out our new persistent caching to all builds on Aurora and Cybele. You should expect improved build time consistency with this roll out. As a reminder Docker images are not cached between pipeline https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/docker/known-limitations/. 

Please contact us if you see anything new that concerns you at support@snap-ci.com
