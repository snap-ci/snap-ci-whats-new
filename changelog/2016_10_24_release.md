Delete Heroku Keys

* SSH keys are no longer a recommended means of authenticating with Heroku, and they are being removed in this release.

System updates were made to:

 * Aurora stack
 * Cybele stack

These changes should not have any impact on your builds, but don't hesitate to [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us) if you face any issues.
