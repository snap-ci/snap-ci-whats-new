Remove Old Heroku SSH Keys

* As previously announced on September 6th, SSH keys are no longer a recommended means of authenticating with Heroku.
* On that date, Snap disabled the generation of new Heroku SSH keys and informed Heroku users of the upcoming change.
* This release removes old Heroku SSH keys that were generated prior to 9/6/16.

System updates were made to:

 * Aurora stack
 * Cybele stack

These changes should not have any impact on your builds, but don't hesitate to [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us) if you face any issues.
