This update is for the [Aurora] (https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/stacks/) stack only. 

Yum repositories changes:

* We are changing the way that we control our yum repositories in order to have more control over package updates. This change will help us ensure you always get the packages you expect as part of your builds. The change should not impact any current running builds.

Packages upgrades:

* We have changed our google-chrome build. Because of that, you might note that the google-chrome package name had changed, but the version is still the same. There is no action required from your side.

* The package PackageKit is not part of the available packages anymore. You can still install it if your build requires it. Please, let us know if you have any concerns about this change.

* Some other packages have been upgraded. Your builds should not be impacted as these are minor changes. You can [check the differences](https://s3.amazonaws.com/whats-new-prod/assets/packages/centos/diff-371-to-415.html) and also the complete list of packages in our [documentation](https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/complete-package-list/).

If you have any concerns about these changes, please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).
