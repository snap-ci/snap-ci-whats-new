Yum repositories changes:

* We are changing the way that we control our yum repositories in order to have more control over the next package updates. This change should not cause any side effect in the current running builds.

Packages upgraded:

* We have changed our google-chrome build. Because of that, you might note that the google-chrome package name had changed, but the version is still the same, thus there is no action required from your side.

* The package PackageKit is not part of the available packages anymore. You can still install it if your build requires it. Please, let us know if you have any major concern about this change.

* Some packages have been upgraded. Users builds should not be impacted as these are minor changes. You can [check the differences](https://s3.amazonaws.com/whats-new-prod/assets/packages/centos/diff-371-to-415.html) and also the complete list of packages in our [documentation](https://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/complete-package-list/).

If you have any concerns about these changes, please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).
