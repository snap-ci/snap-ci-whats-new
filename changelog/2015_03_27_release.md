Github organization permissions changes

* Github introduced the concept of organization level authorization for third-party applications.
* If your organization is not listed when adding a repository, just follow the instructions on the [*Missing any organization?*](https://snap-ci.com/github_repositories/new) link.
* More details can be found on Github's [blog post](https://help.github.com/articles/about-third-party-application-restrictions/).

Small improvements, bug fixes

* Fixed a bug that prevented snapshot dependencies to be update when it was already in cache
* Now you can select multiple prefixes in [automatic branch tracking](https://docs.snap-ci.com/working-with-branches/automatic-branch-tracking/)
