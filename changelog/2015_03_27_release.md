Github organization permissions changes

* Github introduced the concept of organization level authorization for third-party applications.
* If your organization is not listed when adding a repository, just follow the instructions on the [*Missing any organization?*](https://snap-ci.com/github_repositories/new) link.
* More details can be found on Github's [blog post](https://help.github.com/articles/about-third-party-application-restrictions/).

Small improvements, bug fixes

* Now you can select multiple prefixes in [automatic branch tracking](https://docs.snap-ci.com/working-with-branches/automatic-branch-tracking/).
* Build caches now preserve the creation time of the files. This can be helpful when you want to replace files only when they are older than a certain time as well as for builds that use Ivy which won't download the dependencies everytime and can take advantage of the cache.
* Other small UI glitches.
