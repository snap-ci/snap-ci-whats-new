Changes to Heroku credentials

* For new Heroku credentials, we will [no longer save and upload a ssh key to Heroku](https://docs.snap-ci.com/deployments/heroku-deployments/).
* For existing Heroku deployments that use ssh keys an upcoming change will be made on September 30th. Affected individuals will be contacted.

If you have any questions about these changes, please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).
