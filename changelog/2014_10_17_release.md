The OpenSSL Poodle Vulnerability

* As of 15th Oct 2014, in response to the [OpenSSL Poodle vulnerability](https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf) ([CVE-2014-3566](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566)) we have disabled SSLv3 and switched all our connections to TLS while we patch our openssl.

Some other minor bug fixes

* Better error handling on pipeline edit configuration page when connecting to external services like GitHub and Heroku.
