Github organization permissions changes

* Github introduced the concept of [organization level authorization for third-party applications](https://help.github.com/articles/about-third-party-application-restrictions/).
* In light of this, if you can't find your organization when setting up a build, [follow these instructions](https://snap-ci.com/github_repositories/new).

Small improvements, bug fixes

* You can now select multiple branch name prefixes when setting up [automatic branch tracking](https://docs.snap-ci.com/working-with-branches/automatic-branch-tracking/).
* Build caches now preserve the creation time of the files so that dependency management tools like Ivy can take advantage of the cache and download only newer files.
* Fixes for a couple of small UI glitches on the build plan configuration page.
