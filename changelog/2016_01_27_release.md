Dropping support for Python 3.2:

* We will soon remove Python 3.2 from our supported versions.
* If you are currently using 3.2, you will need to update you build to use a different version. If you cannot upgrade from this version, please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).

Upgrading CouchDB to 1.6.1:

* We will be upgrading CouchDB from version 1.0.4 to version 1.6.1 soon.
