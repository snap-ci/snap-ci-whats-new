Bug fixes:

* Some users builds were broken due to invalid UTF-8 characters in their
  tests output, even though the tests were passing. Now we are parsing
  out invalid UTF-8 characters from test reports.

Increased disk space for bigger workers:

* By default a worker has 10GB disk space. From now onwards, the disk space
  will increase proportionally to the worker size. E.g.: A worker of
size 2x will have 20GB disk space.
