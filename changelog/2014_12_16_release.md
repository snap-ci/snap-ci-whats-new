A bunch of new packages now in available for your builds

* Ruby `2.1.5` is now available for builds.

Easier and faster to use npm

* `node_modules` directory is now automatically cached across stages and builds. Your npm installs will now be faster once the cache is primed.

Support for repository renames

* When you rename a repository in GitHub and push a new commits, Snap recognizes this name change and any collaborator of the repositories to rename the build in Snap to the new name.
* Please note that this implies all URLs to the build will be updated and the old ones will stop working hence any CCTray, Snap webhook notifications for builds will break and you may have to update those urls.

Minor changes to the build environment

* We've upgraded bundler from `v1.6.3` to `v1.7.9`.
* Foreman is no longer installed by default, if you'd like to install foreman, please include it in your `Gemfile` or run `sudo $(which gem) install foreman --no-ri --no-rdoc`.

Some bug fixes and nice to haves

* We now provide a link to GitHub Pull Request URLs from the pull-request build history page.
* Snap will now clone secure files and secure environment variables when a pull-request is submitted from the same repository, or a branch is created.
* Fixed some issues with favicon on Safari.
