Exit command behaviour change:

* Some time ago we introduced [a more shell-like environment to run your build](https://blog.snap-ci.com/blog/2014/11/04/shell-changes/). As mentioned in the section "Changes with the exit command", any exit command will cause your session to end. In this case, your build used to be mark as failed, which is a misleading behaviour if you are expecting a `exit 0` command to make your stage to pass. From now on, any exit command will mark your stage as error.

If you have any concerns about this change, please [contact us](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us).
