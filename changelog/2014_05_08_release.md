Multiple language support has landed on Snap!

* Polygot projects are more than welcome. For example you can choose Ruby and Java on the same project.
* Please navigate to your project build plan to add extra languagues to existing projects.

We have improved handling of Heroku and GitHub connectivity issues.

* Any error connecting to Heroku or GitHub is flagged on your pipeline's build history.
* This works well with the repair OAuth with Heroku and GitHub feature we released a couple of weeks ago.

Gem release stages display the version of the gem deployed to RubyGems.

Our favicon changes to a mini build indicator on the build history page. You can keep an eye on your build without switching tabs!
