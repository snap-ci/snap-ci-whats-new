System update

* Fixed DNS resolver configuration in Cybele containers.
* Fixed a bug that prevented users from setting a global secure environment variable.
* Changed the manner in which tasks are executed in Snap. All tasks run as a single combined script. Any `snap-wait`s will now be applied to the entire script (the largest value takes precedence if applied multiple times).
