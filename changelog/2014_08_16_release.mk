Now it's easier to PHP on Snap!

* You can now use the commands `add-php-configuration path/to/extension.ini` and `enable-php-extension extname` to add custom configuration ini files and enable extensions!
* In addition to these changes we also added support for the version *5.6RC2*!
* Check our [docs](http://docs.snap-ci.com/the_ci_environment/languages/#php) for more info.
