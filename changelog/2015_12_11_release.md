Reverted: Fixed version of npm

* Some users were complaining about unexpected build failures due to incompatible
version of installed `npm`. Hence we reverted the latest
change and do not install any specific version of npm. From now on, if
the users want to use a specific version of npm other than the one that
comes with NodeJS installed from `nvm`, they can install it through the command line, e.g. `npm
install npm@3.3.12 -g`
