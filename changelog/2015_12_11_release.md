Fixed version of npm reverted

* Some users were complaining about build failures due to incompatible
versions between node and npm, because of that we reverted the latest
changes and do not install any specific version of npm. From now on, if
the users want to use a specific version of npm other than the one that
comes with node, they can install it through the command line, e.g. `npm
install npm@3.3.12 -g`
