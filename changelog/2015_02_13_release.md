New fine-grained notifications

* In wake of a number of requests to provide control over what kind of notifications you receive from Snap builds, we now provide you the flexibility to choose the type of event you wish to receive notifications on the different notification channels you've configured.
* You can visit the Notifications center from the build history page of your repository to configure your notifications. We would like to hear your [feedback](https://snap-ci.com/contact-us) about the new changes in the notifications.

Support for `Postgres 9.4`

* Snap now supports `postgresql 9.4`. Edit your pipeline configuration to start using the new database.

Support for `git 2.3`

* All your builds now run with `git 2.3.0`. GitHub has an excellent [blog post](https://github.com/blog/1957-git-2-3-has-been-released) about the new git release.

Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug that prevented the environment variables declared in the pipeline configuration from being serialized for the first build.
* Small changes to improve the rendering of the homepage on mobile devices.
