Big stuff for the new year.

Happy new year! We bring a bunch of major features the new year around

* You may now run any of your stages across multiple workers. See our [blog](https://blog.snap-ci.com/blog/2014/12/19/faster-builds-multiple-workers/) and [documentation](https://docs.snap-ci.com/speeding-up-builds/test-parallelism/) for more information.
* Snap now allows you to limit what GitHub permissions you provide to us. See our [blog post](https://blog.snap-ci.com/blog/2015/01/07/choose-github-scopes/) for more information.
* Improved the API to trigger pipelines and stages. You can now pass in environment variables when triggering via the API. Read more about this in our [documentation](https://docs.snap-ci.com/api/manual-trigger/).

Little things

* Ruby `2.2.0` is now available for builds.
* We now clone a project configuration from the branch on which a pull-request was issued. We would earlier clone the configuration from your master branch.
