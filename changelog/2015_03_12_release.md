New features!

* Previously available only for manual stages, Snap now allows you to rerun any stage in your pipeline.
* Your builds in Snap now get renamed automatically whenever you change the repository name in GitHub. Yay!
* Other small bug fixes on build configuration edit page and pull request build configurations.
