<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># DIFF BETWEEN 415 AND 1012
# 1) The packages that we build have the date in the name, so they will appear as modified. You may want to remove them
# 2) You probably want to put some colour on this. I used http://pygments.org/, but it&#39;s not awesome, so feel free to use another one and update this readme
# 3) This diff uses a heuritics to determine the package name, so pay attention to check if it in fact makes sense
# 4) We have a list of all installed packages in our documentation. It&#39;s automatically updated once we deploy the docs, so you should trigger a docs build in order to update that
