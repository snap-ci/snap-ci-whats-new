Support for repository renames

* When you rename a repository in GitHub and push a new commits, Snap recognizes this name change and allows billing owners of the repositories to rename the build in Snap to the new name.
* Please note that this implies all URLs to the build will be updated and the old ones will stop working hence any CCTray, Snap webhook notifications for builds will break and you may have to update those urls.

Minor changes to the build environment

* We've upgraded bundler from `v1.6.3` to `v1.7.9`.
* Foreman is no longer installed by default, if you'd like to install foreman, please include it in your `Gemfile` or run `sudo $(which gem) install foreman --no-ri --no-rdoc`.
