* We've upgraded bundler from `v1.6.3` to `v1.7.9`.
* Foreman is no longer installed by default, if you'd like to install foreman, please include it in your `Gemfile` or run `sudo $(which gem) install foreman --no-ri --no-rdoc`.

Support for repository renames

* When you rename a repository in GitHub and push a new commit, Snap now recognizes this and allows billing owners of the repositories to rename the build in Snap to the new name.
* Please note that this implies any CCTray, Snap webhook notifications for public builds will break and you may have to update those urls.
